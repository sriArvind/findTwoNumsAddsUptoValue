# findTwoNumsAddsUptoValue
Find Two Numbers that Add upto a Value

**Problem Statement #**

**Note: Do not use array methods to solve this problem**

In this problem, you have to implement the findSum(arr, value) function, which takes an array arr, a number and value as input and returns an array of two numbers that add up to value.

Note: In case there is more than one pair in the array containing numbers that add up to value, you are required to return only one such pair. If no such pair found then simply return false.

**Input #**

An array and a number value

**Output #**

An array with two integers a and b ([a,b]) that add up to value

**Sample Input #**

arr = [1,21,3,14,5,60,7,6]

value = 81

**Sample Output #**

arr = [21,60]
